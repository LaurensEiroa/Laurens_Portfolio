This webpage has been build by Laurens Eiroa Sattler and contains a Data Science Portafolio. Making use of public and private (only 1 project) datasets, the intencion of this portafolio is to show how the combination of bigs amounts of data together with Machine- and Deep-Learning knowleadge can bevery helpfull for the interpretation and automation of data related tasks. Different projects of various fields has been developed, to show that Data Science is a discipline that can be aplied to numerous fields regardless from the sector.

## [Project 1: Narma10 Identification System](https://github.com/LaurensEiroa/Narma10-System-Identification/blob/master/EchoStateNetwork.ipynb)
-A system Identification task using a Recurrent Neural Network is performed making use of the Reservoir Computing paradigm.

## [Project 2: B.E.R.T. ChatBot]()
- Deep-Learning NLP models have proved to have very good performance on Language Understanding and classification. In this project we develope a Mental Health Chatbot that is able to take a input sentence related to Mental Health and provide an answer to this inputsentence. We also prove that pre-trained models (BERT model) can provide better performance than the so called one-hot-encoding methods.

## [Project 3: Deep Dutch-French translator]()
- Sequence to Sequence Deep-Learning models can be very good arquitectures for translation tasks. Using translated sequences from EU laws, we develope and compare different sequence to sequece deep-learning state-of-the-art models for the translation task.

## [Project 4: Stars Fundamental Atmospheric parameter Determination]()
- This work belongs to an academic research, that is being currently done. The objective of this academical research is to show that Deep-Learning techniques can be used for the determination of fundamental atmospheric star parameters by means of the observed stellar spectrum. Since the available data that can be find in the literature contains high degrees of uncertaity. We prove how training the network with Kuruz sintetic spectra, can produce state-of-the-art results
