This webpage has been build by Laurens Eiroa Sattler and contains a Data Science Portafolio. Making use of public and private (only 1 project) datasets, the intencion of this portafolio is to show how the combination of bigs amounts of data together with Machine- and Deep-Learning knowleadge can bevery helpfull for the interpretation and automation of data related tasks. Different projects of various fields has been developed, to show that Data Science is a discipline that can be aplied to numerous fields regardless from the sector.

## [Project 1: Narma10 Identification System](https://github.com/LaurensEiroa/Narma10-System-Identification/blob/master/EchoStateNetwork.ipynb)
-A system Identification task using a Recurrent Neural Network is performed making use of the Reservoir Computing paradigm.

## [Project 2: B.E.R.T. ChatBot]()
- Deep-Learning NLP models have proved to have very good performance on Language Understanding and classification. In this project we develope a Mental Health Chatbot that is able to take a input sentence related to Mental Health and provide an answer to this inputsentence. We also prove that pre-trained models (BERT model) can provide better performance than the so called one-hot-encoding methods.

## [Project 3: Deep Dutch-French translator]()
- Sequence to Sequence Deep-Learning models can be very good arquitectures for translation tasks. Using translated sequences from EU laws, we develope and compare different sequence to sequece deep-learning state-of-the-art models for the translation task.

## [Project 4: Stars Fundamental Atmospheric parameter Determination]()
- Stars together with gas and dust particles constitute the basic ingredients of the visible universe. Therefore, the determination of the fundamental, physical stellar parameters is a basic pilar in our knowledge of the universe. This academic work, carried out in collaboration with  Dr. Benjamin Montesinos of the Center of Astrobiology, presents a deep learning approach to predict the stellar parameters temperature, gravity, metallicity, and rotational and radial velocities.
