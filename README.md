This webpage contains several projects of various different fields.

## [Project 1: Narma10 Identification System](https://github.com/LaurensEiroa/Narma10-System-Identification/blob/master/EchoStateNetwork.ipynb)
-A system Identification task using a Recurrent Neural Network is performed making use of the Reservoir Computing paradigm.

## [Project 2: B.E.R.T. ChatBot]()
- Deep-Learning NLP models have proved to have very good performance on Language Understanding and classification. In this project we develope a Mental Health Chatbot that is able to take a input sentence related to Mental Health and provide an answer to this inputsentence. We also prove that pre-trained models (BERT model) can provide better performance than the so called one-hot-encoding methods.

## [Project 2: Deep Dutch-French translator]()
- Sequence to Sequence Deep-Learning models can be very good arquitectures for translation tasks. Using translated sequences from EU laws, we develope and compare different sequence to sequece deep-learning state-of-the-art models for the translation task.
